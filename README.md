# Tile Matching Game

The classic memory game where you flip tiles over and match them in pairs. How many tries can you finish it in 😏? Built with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS, plus Bootstrap for UI.

Demonstrates my ability to do direct DOM manipulation, and also build classes in vanilla Javascript.

Tech used: Javascript, HTML, CSS (grid, flexbox, responsiveness), Bootstrap, Font Awesome.
